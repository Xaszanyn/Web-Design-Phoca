  <h3>4.ADVERTISING</h3>

    We use advertising to fund our Services and to make our games available for free. We offer our Games for free and in
    order to do that we need to share the information we collect from you with our third-party advertising partners. As
    a safeguard to protect your privacy, we only store personal information temporarily. The information collected helps
    us to improve our websites and Games and &ndash; at the same time &ndash; keep our Games free for a wide player
    base.
  </p>

  <p>If you are a European Economic Area (EEA) &ndash; based user be aware that:</p>

  <p>
    (a) When you use our Games, we rely on our legitimate interest to show advertisements to you. The legal basis to
    show ads to EEA-based users is the legitimate interest in accordance with the European data protection requirements
    under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. In addition, data processing agreements were concluded with external ad technology
    providers networks in accordance with the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.We also ensure that our external service
    providers are committed to a high level of data protection by concluding data protection agreements.
  </p>

  <p>
    (b) Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for the purposes of personalized advertising, we
    always ask for your consent, given when you press accept at the relevant button at the loading of the Game. We allow
    our advertising partners to show personalized ads to you only if you have pressed ACCEPT in relevant pop-up window
    and so consented to the sharing of your personal information for the purposes of personalized advertising. Our
    advertising partners use different technologies for the purposes of personalized advertising that process your
    personal information in different ways, so please review their data processing practices before you ACCEPT to show
    you personalized ads at the loading of the Game. The list of our current advertising partners with links to their
    privacy policies is available
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2LFTLtt3HuhMfJYkl-zTaSB69lmYE0QFH54yV0Wt4o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
    The legal basis to show personalized ads to EEA-based users is consent in accordance with the European data
    protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. In addition, data processing agreements were concluded
    with external ad technology providers networks in accordance with the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR. We also ensure
    that our external service providers are committed to a high level of data protection by concluding data protection
    agreements. The purpose is to improve our Games and provide the player with more relevant ads. You have an option to

    choosing to which advertising you would like to get. When you decide to withdraw your consent or if you do not
    provide your consent, you may still see the same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less
    relevant because they won&rsquo;t be based on topics you like, your interest, behavior, demographics, etc. Our
    advertising partners may continue to show you ads based on the content of the application you are using.
  </p>

  <h4>4.2. In-game advertising (i.e. when you view ads in Our Games)</h4>

  <p>
    To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad networks) to
    enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party properties. You can control and
    limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in our
    games (it is controlled by ad networks), but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our
    advertising partners listed
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2LFTLtt3HuhMfJYkl-zTaSB69lmYE0QFH54yV0Wt4o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>)
    including:
  </p>

  <p>
    limit the number of times you see the same ad;<br />ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not
    &lsquo;automated&rsquo; bots;<br />serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your
    advertising ID engagement with other brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising ID and using your general
    geographic area. Other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their
    products in Our Games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as an intermediary between the other game companies and
    Us. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of
    other developers&rsquo; applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using
    Advertiser ID;<br />keep track of what games you have used to market you similar kinds of games. IP-address is
    typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country,
    state, and sometimes at the city level).
  </p>

  <h4>4.3. View of Our ads on third-party services</h4>

  <p>
    We also advertise Games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve them to audiences that will be interested in
    them (determined using Advertising IDs).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our
    advertising partners listed
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2LFTLtt3HuhMfJYkl-zTaSB69lmYE0QFH54yV0Wt4o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>)
    including:
  </p>

  <p>
    measuring ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs they generate through their advertising
    in other publishers&rsquo; games);<br />informing players, that have not been playing for a while, about new content
    in the Game. We give a list of these users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then shows
    these users ads about the new content;<br />not showing ads on a game that a player is already playing. We can send
    a list of active players in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then excludes these players
    from seeing the ad;<br />marketing games to a group of potential players.
  </p>

  <h4>4.4. WHO CAN SHOW PERSONALIZED ADS TO YOU?</h4>

  <p>
    Please see the list of advertising providers that are allowed to show personalized advertising and review their data
    processing practices, including the technologies they use for the purposes of personalized advertising
